        <h2 class="text text-center animate__animated animate__headShake">Game Design</h2>
        <p class="ms-2">Lead developer Ken Levine had created Irrational Games in 1997 out of former members from
          Looking Glass
          Studios. Their first game was System Shock 2, a sequel to Looking Glass's System Shock, and was met with
          critical success, though it did not prove a financial one. Levine had attempted to pitch a sequel to System
          Shock 2 to Electronic Arts, but the publisher rejected the idea based on the poor performance of the earlier
          game. Irrational would proceed to develop other games, including Freedom Force, Tribes: Vengeance, the
          canceled title Deep Cover, and the completed The Lost which was never released due to legal complications. At
          this point, Levine wanted to return to a game in the same style as System Shock 2, a more free-form game with
          strong narrative.</p>


        <p class="ms-2">In 2002, the team had come up with a core gameplay mechanic idea based on three groups of
          forces; drones that
          would carry a desirable resource, protectors that would guard the drones, and harvesters that would attempt to
          take the resource from the drones; these would eventually bear out as the Little Sisters, Big Daddies, and
          Splicers in the final game, but at the time of the concept, there was no set theme. They began working on
          creating a setting for the game as to be able to pitch the idea to game publishers. A 2002 demonstration
          version was based on the Unreal Engine 2 for the first Xbox. This demonstration was primarily set aboard a
          space station overtaken with genetically-mutated monsters; the main character was Carlos Cuello, a "cult
          deprogrammer"â€”a person charged with rescuing someone from a cult, and mentally and psychologically readjusting
          that person to a normal life. Ken Levine cites an example of what a cult deprogrammer does: "[There are]
          people who hired people to [for example] deprogram their daughter who had been in a lesbian relationship. They
          kidnap her and reprogram her, and it was a really dark person, and that was the [kind of] character that you
          were." This story would have been more political in nature, with the character hired by a Senator. The team
          collectively agreed that this game was not what they had set out to make, and were having trouble finding a
          publisher. They considered ending development, but as news about their efforts to create a spiritual successor
          to System Shock 2 began to appear in gaming magazines and websites, the team opted to continue development,
          performing a full revamp of the game.</p>

        <p class="ms-2">By 2004, 2K Games, a subsidiary of Take-Two Interactive, offered to publish the game primarily
          based on the
          drone/protector/harvester concept, giving Irrational the freedom to develop the story and setting. By this
          point, the story and setting had changed significantly, taking place in an abandoned World War II-era Nazi
          laboratory that had been recently unearthed by 21st-century scientists. Over the decades, the genetic
          experiments within the labs had gradually formed themselves into an ecosystem centered on the three groups.
          This version of the game included many of the gameplay elements that would remain in the final BioShock,
          themselves influenced by concepts from System Shock 2. These elements included the use of plasmids and EVE,
          the need to use stealth or other options to deal with automated security systems, direction through the
          environment from a non-player character relayed over a radio, and story elements delivered through audio
          recordings and "ghosts" of deceased characters.</p>

        <p class="ms-2">While the gameplay with the 2004 reveal was similar to what resulted in the released version of
          BioShock,
          both design and story changed, consistent with what Levine says was then-Irrational Games' guiding principle
          of putting game design first. These areas were also issued due to some internal strife and lack of
          communication between the various teams within Irrational, part of the result of having to expand the team
          from six to sixty members for the scope of the project. The environment was considered bland, and there were
          difficulties by the team's artists to come up with a consistent vision to meet the level designer's goals. A
          critical junction was a short experiment performed by level designer Jean Paul LeBreton and artist Hoagy de la
          Plante, setting themselves aside to co-develop a level that would later become part of the "Tea Garden" area
          in the released game, which Levine would later use as a prime example of a "great BioShock space", emphasizing
          the need for departments to work together. Levine also found that the cyberpunk theme had been overplayed
          considering their initial reject from Electronic Arts for System Shock 3, leading towards the underwater
          setting of Rapture.</p>

        <p class="ms-2">The game's lead level designer was Bill Gardner. He cited Capcom's survival horror series
          Resident Evil as a
          significant influence on BioShock, stating there are "all these nods and all these little elements that I
          think you can see where Resident Evil inspired us". The team were particularly influenced by Resident Evil 4,
          including its approach to the environments, combat, and tools, its game design and tactical elements, its
          "gameplay fuelled storytelling" and inventory system, and its opening village level in terms of how it
          "handled the sandbox nature of the combat" and in terms of "the environment".</p>

              <h2 class="card-title">Graphics Engine</h2>
              <p class="card-text"> BioShock uses a heavily
                modified Unreal Engine 2.5 with some of the advanced technologies from Unreal Engine 3. Irrational Games
                had previous experience with modifying and expanding on the Unreal Engine in SWAT 4, and continued this
                advancement of the engine within BioShock. One significant improvement they added was improved water
                effects, given the nature of the game's setting, hiring a programmer and artist to focus on the water
                effects. This graphical enhancement has been lauded by critics, with GameSpot saying, "Whether it's
                standing water on the floor or sea water in after an explosion, it will blow you away every time
                you see it." BioShock also uses the Havofor an enhancement of in-game
                physics, the integration of ragdoll physics, and allows for more lifelike movement by elements of the
                environment. The Windows version was built to work in both Direct3D 10 (DirectX 10) and DirectX 9, with
                the DirectX 10 version supporting additional water and particle effects.</p>

                <h2>Soundtrack</h2>
              </h5>
              <p class="card-text">BioShock contains both licensed music and an original score. The licensed music
                from the 1930s, 1940s, and 1950s can be heard playing on phonograph throughout Rapture. In total, 30
                licensed songs can be heard throughout the game. The original score was composed by Garry Schyman. He
                composed his pieces with the chosen licensed music as to keep the same feel, while also
                trying to bring out something that was "eerie, frightening and at times beautiful" to mesh well with
                Rapture's environments.

              </p>
              <p class="card-text">2K Games released an orchestral score soundtrack on their official homepage on
                August 24, 2007. Available in MP3 format, the score contains 12 of the 22 tracks from the game. The
                Limited Edition version of the game came with The Rapture EP remixes by Moby and Oscar The Punk. The
                three remixed tracks on the CD include "Beyond the Sea", "God Bless the Child" and "Wild Little
                Sisters"; the original recordings of these songs are in the game. BioShock's score was released on a
                vinyl LP with the BioShock 2 Special Edition.</p>
