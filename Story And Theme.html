            <p>The thematic core of BioShock was born
              when the lead developer of the game, Ken Levine, was walking at Rockefeller Center near the GE Building in
              New York City. He saw the uniqueness of the art deco styling of the building along with imagery around the
              building such as the statue of Atlas near it, and recognized that these were spaces that had not been
              experienced in the first-person shooter genre. The history of the Rockefeller Center also fed into the
              story
              concept; Levine noted how the Center had started construction prior to the Great Depression; when the
              primary financiers had pulled out, John D. Rockefeller backed the remaining construction to complete the
              project himself, as stated by Edge magazine "a great man building an architectural triumph against all the
              odds". The history of Rapture and the character of Andrew Ryan is loosely based on Rockefeller's story. He
              also considered that many of the characters of Rapture were all people who were oppressed once before in
              their lives and now free of that oppression, have turned around and become the oppressors, a fact he felt
              resonated throughout human history.</p>
          </div>
        </div>
        <div class="containerPlay text-center">
          <div class="row">
            <div class="col">
              <div
                class="color  p-2 text-white bg-opacity-75 p-3 ms-3 me-3 mt-3 rounded-5 animate__animated animate__zoomInRight animate__delay-1s">
                <p> At this point in the development, the
                  backdrop of Rapture had been fleshed out, but they had yet to come on how to represent the drones,
                  protectors, and harvesters from their original game idea. The Big Daddy concept as the protector class
                  was developed early in the process, but the team had yet to reach a satisfying design for the drones,
                  having used several possible designs including bugs and dogs in wheelchairs. The team wanted to have
                  the
                  player care for the drones in some way and create pathos for these characters. The idea of using
                  little
                  girls came out of brainstorming, but was controversial and shocking within the team at first,
                  recognizing that they could easily be killed and make the game more horrific in the style of Night
                  Trap.
                  However, as Levine worked on the story, he started to incorporate the ideas of dystopian and utopian
                  thinkers from the twentieth century, including Ayn Rand, Aldous Huxley, and George Orwell, and
                  considered their ideas "fascinating". He brought in the ideas of Objectivism that Rand primarily
                  outlined in the book Atlas Shrugged, that man should be driven by selfishness and not altruism, and
                  used
                  this to inform the philosophy behind the city of Rapture and Andrew Ryan's work, viewing them as quite
                  ludicrous, and primed to be applied to an antagonist, tied in with his previous observations on
                  Rockefeller and his writings. This was extended to the use of the little girls as drones (now Little
                  Sisters), particularly the question whether the player should try to save the girls or harvest the
                  ADAM
                  for their benefit. 2K Games expressed concern about the initial mechanic of the Little Sisters, where
                  the player would actively prey on the Little Sister, which would have alerted a Big Daddy and setting
                  up
                  the fight with the player. This approach did not sit well with Levine, and 2K Games asserted that they
                  would not ship a game "where the player gets punished for doing the right thing". They altered this
                  approach where the Little Sisters would be invulnerable until the player had dealt with their Big
                  Daddy,
                  though LeBreton considered this "a massive kludge" into the game's fiction. The idea of creating the
                  Little Sisters and presenting the player with this choice became a critical part of the game's appeal
                  to
                  the broader gaming market though would still be met with criticism from some outlets. Levine desired
                  only to have one ending to the game, something that would have left the fate of the characters "much
                  more ambiguous", but publisher pressure directed them to craft multiple endings depending on the
                  choice
                  of harvesting Little Sisters. Levine also noted that "it was never my intention to do two endings for
                  the game. It sort of came very late and it was something that was requested by somebody up the food
                  chain from me".</p>

                    <p> Other elements came into the story
                      design. Levine had an interest in "stem cell research and the moral issues that go around [it]".
                      Regarding artistic influences, Levine cited the books Nineteen Eighty-Four and Logan's Run,
                      representing societies that have "really interesting ideas screwed up by the fact that we're
                      people". The idea of the mind control used on Jack was offered by LeBreton, inspired by films like
                      The Manchurian Candidate, as a means to provide a better reason to limit the player's actions as
                      opposed to the traditional use of locked doors to prevent them exploring areas they should not.
                      The
                      team had agreed that Jack's actions would be controlled by a key phrase but struggled with coming
                      up
                      with one that would not reveal Atlas' true nature. Levine happened upon "Would you kindly" after
                      working on marketing materials for the game that asked the reader hypothetical questions such as
                      "Would you kill people, even innocent people, to survive?", later working that phrase into the
                      first
                      script for the game.</p>

                        <p> Near the anticipated completion date,
                          2K decided to give Irrational another three months to polish up the game, extending the
                          current
                          crunch time the studio was already under. This left some hard-to-discover bugs and issues in
                          the
                          game undiscovered. One such case was an apparent Easter egg found in the remastered version in
                          2018, where under certain conditions, the player can end up looking at an object with the
                          description "Paul Hellquist did not do his Job". Both Levine and Chris Kline, the game's lead
                          programmer confirmed the message was a cheeky jab at Hellquist left as a debugging message;
                          Kline and Hellquist were developing the systems to show descriptions of objects to players
                          when
                          looked at, and Hellquist offered to complete all the necessary descriptions in-game; to
                          jokingly
                          help prod Hellquist along, Kline put "Paul Hellquist did not do his Job" as the default
                          message
                          within the executable code. While the code message was changed for the original release, the
                          remastered version likely used a pre-final version of the BioShock code, according to Kline.
                          Hellquist took the revelation in good humor and tweeted that other Easter eggs should have
                          been
                          added to the game to display, "If you are enjoying this, Paul Hellquist did his job".</p>

                            <p> A critical playtest of the game
                              occurred in January 2007, where initial feedback from the players was mostly negative,
                              including issues of the setting being too dark, having no idea where to go, and
                              distrusting
                              Atlas, who at the time was voiced in a southern drawl, described as a "lecherous Colonel
                              Sanders". The team took this criticism to heart, revamping several elements during those
                              extra months such as improving the lighting, implementing a quest marker, and using an
                              Irish
                              voice for Atlas to make him sound more trustworthy. During another late-stage playtest
                              with
                              the title "ninety-nine percent" complete according to Levine, the playtesters did not like
                              the game at all as they felt no connection to the player-character Jack, and the person
                              overseeing the tests told Levine that the game was likely to be a failure. At this point,
                              BioShock did not have many cutscenes, as Levine was ideologically opposed to them.
                              However,
                              the following day, Levine and the lead group came up with a "cheap" way to correct this,
                              by
                              adding the initial cut scene within the plane and the subsequent plane crash, as this
                              helped
                              to set the time frame, place the player in the role of the character, and alluded to the
                              "would you kindly" line later in the game. Levine likened this approach to the initial
                              aircraft crash at the onset of the television show Lost to quickly establish character and
                              setting.</p>

                                  Levine felt that the game could have used about six more months of development to
                                  improve the gun combat system and fix lagging issues that occurred during the final

                                    <p> In a 2018 interview,
                                      Levine had come to recognize that BioShock reflected several Jewish themes, though
                                      this was not intentional. Levine, who considers himself culturally Jewish but does
                                      not follow Judaism, had grown up in New Jersey but spent much of his childhood
                                      time
                                      with his father who worked in Manhattan's Diamond District and visiting his
                                      grandparents in Queens, a neighborhood with a large proportion of Eastern European
                                      immigrants. Thus, Levine was exposed to much of the Jewish culture that flourished
                                      in the area following World War II and understood some of the anxiety Jewish
                                      people
                                      faced.[44] In the 2018 interview, Levine recognized several of the characters,
                                      including Andrew Ryan (who was inspired by Ayn Rand who was also Jewish), Sander
                                      Cohen, and Brigid Tenenbaum, were written all as Jewish, and all seeking to escape
                                      a
                                      world they felt they did not fit into by going to Rapture; Levine said "There's
                                      literal displacement and then there's a feeling of not fitting in, of 'I don't
                                      really belong here'. I think Jews are always going to feel a little bit like they
                                      don't belong wherever they are. There's always that 'what if we have to flee'
                                      mentality".</p>
