                <h2>Critical response</h2>
                <p>BioShock has received "universal acclaim", according to review aggregator Metacritic, with the game
                    receiving an average review score of 96/100 for Xbox 360 and Microsoft Windows, and 94/100 for
                    PlayStation 3. As of October 2020, it is one of the highest-rated games on Metacritic, tied with
                    several other games for the fourth-highest aggregate score. Mainstream press reviews have praised
                    the immersive qualities of the game and its political dimension. The Boston Globe described it as "a
                    beautiful, brutal, and disquieting computer game ... one of the best in years", and compared the
                    game to Whittaker Chambers' 1957 riposte to Atlas Shrugged, "Big Sister Is Watching You". Wired also
                    mentioned the Ayn Rand connection (a partial anagram of Andrew Ryan) in a report on the game which
                    featured a brief interview with Levine. The Chicago Sun-Times review said "I never once thought
                    anyone would be able to create an engaging and entertaining video game around the fiction and
                    philosophy of Ayn Rand, but that is essentially what 2K Games has done ... the rare, mature video
                    game that succeeds in making you think while you play".</p>
                <p>The Los Angeles Times review concluded, "Sure, it's fun to play, looks spectacular and is easy to
                    control. But it also does something no other game has done to date: It really makes you feel." The
                    New York Times reviewer described it as: "intelligent, gorgeous, occasionally frightening" and
                    added, "Anchored by its provocative, morality-based story line, sumptuous art direction and superb
                    voice acting, BioShock can also hold its head high among the best games ever made."</p>
                <p>GameSpy praised BioShock's "inescapable atmosphere", and Official Xbox Magazine lauded its
                    "inconceivably great plot" and "stunning soundtrack and audio effects." The gameplay and combat
                    system have been praised for being smooth and open-ended, and elements of the graphics, such as the
                    water, were commended for their quality. It has been noted that the combination of the game's
                    elements "straddles so many entertainment art forms so expertly that it's the best demonstration yet
                    how flexible this medium can be. It's no longer just another shooter wrapped up in a pretty game
                    engine, but a story that exists and unfolds inside the most convincing and elaborate and artistic
                    game world ever conceived."</p>
                <p>Reviewers did highlight a few negative issues in BioShock, however. The recovery system involving
                    "Vita-Chambers", which revive a defeated player at half-health, but do not alter the enemies'
                    health, makes it possible to wear down enemies through sheer perseverance, and was criticized as one
                    of the most significant flaws in the gameplay. IGN noted that both the controls and graphics of the
                    Xbox 360 version are inferior to those of the PC version, in that switching between weapons or
                    plasmids is easier using the PC's mouse than the 360's radial menu, as well as the graphics being
                    slightly better with higher resolutions. The game has been touted as a hybrid first-person shooter,
                    but two reviewers found advances from comparable games lacking, both in the protagonist and in the
                    challenges he faces. Some reviewers also found the combat behavior of the splicers lacking in
                    diversity (and their A.I. behavior not very well done), and the moral choice too much "black and
                    white" to be interesting. Some reviewers and essayists such as Jonathan Blow also claimed that the
                    "moral choice" the game offered to the player (saving or harvesting the little sisters) was flawed
                    because, to them, it had no real impact on the game, which ultimately lead them to think that the
                    sisters were just mechanics of no real importance. Daniel Friedman for Polygon concurred with Blow,
                    noting that the player only loses 10% of the possible ADAM rewards for saving the Little Sisters
                    rather than killing them, and felt that this would have been better instituted as part of the game
                    difficulty mechanic. Former LucasArts developer Clint Hocking wrote a noted essay that claimed that
                    BioShock exhibited "ludonarrative dissonance" between its story and mechanics, as while he saw the
                    story as advocating selflessness in helping others, its gameplay encourages what he views as
                    selfishness by preying on Little Sisters.</p>

                list of The Top 10 Video Game Openings. GamesRadar placed Bioshock as the 12th best game of all time. In
                2011 BioShock was awarded the number 1 spot in GameTrailers' "Top 100 Video Game Trailers of All Time",
                for submerging the viewer into the BioShock universe and its enduring impact. In August 2012, IGN gave
                it the top spot on their list of the Top 25 Modern PC Games, a ranking of the best PC games released
                since 2006. In November 2012, Time named it one of the 100 greatest video games of all time. In July
                2015, the game placed 9th on USgamer's The 15 Best Games Since 2000 list.</p>

                Journal reported that shares in Take-Two Interactive "soared nearly 20%" in the week following
                overwhelmingly favorable early reviews of the game. Take-Two Interactive announced that by June 5, 2008,
                over 2.2 million copies of BioShock had been shipped. In a June 10, 2008 interview, Roy Taylor, Nvidia's

            <p>In response to the game's high sales and critical acclaim, Take-Two Interactive chairman Strauss Zelnick
                revealed in a post-earnings report call that the company now considered the game part of a franchise. He
                also speculated that any follow-ups would mimic the release cadence of Grand Theft Auto, with a new
                release
                expected every two years. 2K's president Christoph Hartmann stated that BioShock could have five
                sequels, comparing the franchise to the Star Wars movies.</p>

            <p>BioShock 2 was announced in 2008, with its development led by 2K Marin. Levine stated that Irrational
                (then
                2K
                Boston) was not involved in the game's sequel because they wanted to "swing for the fences" and try to
                come
                up
                with something "very, very different", which was later revealed as BioShock Infinite. BioShock 3 was
                also
                announced, with its release assumed to likely coincide with the BioShock film. BioShock 2 takes place
                about
                ten years following the events of the first game. The player assumes the role of Subject Delta, a
                precursor
                of
                the Big Daddies who must search the fallen city of Rapture for his former Little Sister, Eleanor.
                BioShock 2
                was
                released for Windows PC, Mac, Xbox 360, and the PlayStation 3 worldwide on February 9, 2010.</p>

            <p>While BioShock Infinite, developed by Irrational Games and released in 2013, shares the name and many
                similar
                gameplay concepts with BioShock, the title is not a sequel or prequel of the original story, but instead
                takes
                place aboard the collapsing air-city of Columbia in the year 1912. It follows former Pinkerton agent
                Booker
                DeWitt as he is he attempts to rescue a young woman, Elizabeth, from the angelic tower in which her
                father
                has
                imprisoned her. Infinite involves the possibilities of multiple universes. In one scene, the game take
                place at the lighthouse and bathysphere terminus of Rapture as part of this exploration. However, no
                direct
                canonical connection is given in the main game. The episodic expansion, Burial at Sea, takes place in
                Rapture in 1959, before the war between Atlas and Ryan, while continuing the story of Booker and
                Elizabeth.
                This
                content links the two stories while providing expansion on the causes and behind-the-scenes events
                alluded
                to by
                the in-game background from BioShock.</p>

            <p>After completing BioShock Infinite and its expansion, Levine announced that he was restructuring
                Irrational
                Games to focus on smaller, narrative-driven titles. 2K Games continues to hold on to the BioShock
                intellectual
                property and plans to continue to develop games in this series, considering the framework set by Levine
                and
                his
                team as a "rich creative canvas" for more stories.</p>

            <h2>Limited edition</h2>
            <p>Following the creation of a fan petition for a special edition, Take-Two Interactive stated that they
                would
                publish a special edition of BioShock only if the petition received 5,000 signatures;[182] this number
                of
                signatures was reached after just five hours. Subsequently, a poll was posted on the 2K Games operated
                Cult
                of Rapture community website in which visitors could vote on what features they would most like to see
                in a
                special edition; the company stated that developers would take this poll into serious consideration. To
                determine what artwork would be used for the Limited Edition cover, 2K Games ran a contest, with the
                winning
                entry provided by Crystal Clear Art's owner and graphic designer Adam Meyer.</p>

            <p>On April 23, 2007, the Cult of Rapture website confirmed that the Limited Collector's Edition would
                include
                a
                6-inch (150 mm) Big Daddy figurine (many of which were damaged due to a dropped shipping container; a
                replacement initiative is in place), a "Making Of" DVD, and a soundtrack CD. Before the special edition
                was

        announced, with its release assumed to likely coincide with the BioShock film. BioShock 2 takes place about
        ten years following the events of the first game. The player assumes the role of Subject Delta, a precursor of
        the Big Daddies who must search the fallen city of Rapture for his former Little Sister, Eleanor. BioShock 2 was
        released for Windows PC, Mac, Xbox 360, and the PlayStation 3 worldwide on February 9, 2010.</p> 

        <p>While BioShock Infinite, developed by Irrational Games and released in 2013, shares the name and many similar
        gameplay concepts with BioShock, the title is not a sequel or prequel of the original story, but instead takes
        place aboard the collapsing air-city of Columbia in the year 1912. It follows former Pinkerton agent Booker
        DeWitt as he is he attempts to rescue a young woman, Elizabeth, from the angelic tower in which her father has
        imprisoned her. Infinite involves the possibilities of multiple universes. In one scene, the game take
        place at the lighthouse and bathysphere terminus of Rapture as part of this exploration. However, no direct
        canonical connection is given in the main game. The episodic expansion, Burial at Sea, takes place in
        Rapture in 1959, before the war between Atlas and Ryan, while continuing the story of Booker and Elizabeth. This
        content links the two stories while providing expansion on the causes and behind-the-scenes events alluded to by
        the in-game background from BioShock.</p> 

        <p>After completing BioShock Infinite and its expansion, Levine announced that he was restructuring Irrational
        Games to focus on smaller, narrative-driven titles. 2K Games continues to hold on to the BioShock intellectual
        property and plans to continue to develop games in this series, considering the framework set by Levine and his
        team as a "rich creative canvas" for more stories.</p>
