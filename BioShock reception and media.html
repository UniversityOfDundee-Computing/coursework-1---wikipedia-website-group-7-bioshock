                <h2>Critical response</h2>
                <p class="text card ">BioShock has received "universal acclaim", according to review aggregator Metacritic, with the game
                    receiving an average review score of 96/100 for Xbox 360 and Microsoft Windows, and 94/100 for
                    PlayStation 3. As of October 2020, it is one of the highest-rated games on Metacritic, tied with
                    several other games for the fourth-highest aggregate score. Mainstream press reviews have praised
                    the immersive qualities of the game and its political dimension. The Boston Globe described it as "a
                    beautiful, brutal, and disquieting computer game ... one of the best in years", and compared the
                    game to Whittaker Chambers' 1957 riposte to Atlas Shrugged, "Big Sister Is Watching You". Wired also
                    mentioned the Ayn Rand connection (a partial anagram of Andrew Ryan) in a report on the game which
                    featured a brief interview with Levine. The Chicago Sun-Times review said "I never once thought
                    anyone would be able to create an engaging and entertaining video game around the fiction and
                    philosophy of Ayn Rand, but that is essentially what 2K Games has done ... the rare, mature video
                    game that succeeds in making you think while you play".</p>
                <p class="text card">The Los Angeles Times review concluded, "Sure, it's fun to play, looks spectacular and is easy to
                    control. But it also does something no other game has done to date: It really makes you feel." The
                    New York Times reviewer described it as: "intelligent, gorgeous, occasionally frightening" and
                    added, "Anchored by its provocative, morality-based story line, sumptuous art direction and superb
                    voice acting, BioShock can also hold its head high among the best games ever made."</p>
                <p class="text card">GameSpy praised BioShock's "inescapable atmosphere", and Official Xbox Magazine lauded its
                    "inconceivably great plot" and "stunning soundtrack and audio effects." The gameplay and combat
                    system have been praised for being smooth and open-ended, and elements of the graphics, such as the
                    water, were commended for their quality. It has been noted that the combination of the game's
                    elements "straddles so many entertainment art forms so expertly that it's the best demonstration yet
                    how flexible this medium can be. It's no longer just another shooter wrapped up in a pretty game
                    engine, but a story that exists and unfolds inside the most convincing and elaborate and artistic
                    game world ever conceived."</p>
                <p class="text card">Reviewers did highlight a few negative issues in BioShock, however. The recovery system involving
                    "Vita-Chambers", which revive a defeated player at half-health, but do not alter the enemies'
                    health, makes it possible to wear down enemies through sheer perseverance, and was criticized as one
                    of the most significant flaws in the gameplay. IGN noted that both the controls and graphics of the
                    Xbox 360 version are inferior to those of the PC version, in that switching between weapons or
                    plasmids is easier using the PC's mouse than the 360's radial menu, as well as the graphics being
                    slightly better with higher resolutions. The game has been touted as a hybrid first-person shooter,
                    but two reviewers found advances from comparable games lacking, both in the protagonist and in the
                    challenges he faces. Some reviewers also found the combat behavior of the splicers lacking in
                    diversity (and their A.I. behavior not very well done), and the moral choice too much "black and
                    white" to be interesting. Some reviewers and essayists such as Jonathan Blow also claimed that the
                    "moral choice" the game offered to the player (saving or harvesting the little sisters) was flawed
                    because, to them, it had no real impact on the game, which ultimately lead them to think that the
                    sisters were just mechanics of no real importance. Daniel Friedman for Polygon concurred with Blow,
                    noting that the player only loses 10% of the possible ADAM rewards for saving the Little Sisters
                    rather than killing them, and felt that this would have been better instituted as part of the game
                    difficulty mechanic. Former LucasArts developer Clint Hocking wrote a noted essay that claimed that
                    BioShock exhibited "ludonarrative dissonance" between its story and mechanics, as while he saw the
                    story as advocating selflessness in helping others, its gameplay encourages what he views as
                    selfishness by preying on Little Sisters.</p>

            <h2> Awards</h2>
            <p class="text card">At E3 2006, BioShock was given several "Games of the Show" awards from various online gaming sites,
                including GameSpot, IGN, GameSpy and GameTrailers's Trailer of the Year. BioShock received an award for
                Best Xbox 360 Game at the 2007 Leipzig Games Convention. After the game's release, the 2007 Spike TV
                Video Game Awards selected BioShock as Game of the Year, Best Xbox 360 Game, and Best Original Score,
                and nominated it for four awards: Best Shooter, Best Graphics, Best PC Game, and Best Soundtrack. The
                game also won the 2007 BAFTA "Best Game" award. X-Play also selected it as "Game of the Year", "Best
                Original Soundtrack", "Best Writing/Story", and "Best Art Direction". Game Informer named BioShock its
                Game of the Year for 2007.</p>
            <p class="text card">At IGN's "Best of 2007" BioShock was nominated for Game of The Year 2007, and won the award for PC Game
                of the Year, Best Artistic Design, and Best Use of Sound. GameSpy chose it as the third-best game of the
                year and gave BioShock the awards for Best Sound, Story, and Art Direction. GameSpot awarded the game
                for Best Story, while GamePro gave BioShock the Best Story, Xbox 360 and Best Single-Player Shooter
                awards. BioShock won the "Best Visual Art", "Best Writing", and "Best Audio" awards at the 2008 Game
                Developers Choice Awards. Guinness World Records awarded the game a record for "Most Popular Xbox Live
                Demo" in the Guinness World Records: Gamer's Edition 2008. BioShock is ranked first on Game Informer's
                list of The Top 10 Video Game Openings. GamesRadar placed Bioshock as the 12th best game of all time. In
                2011 BioShock was awarded the number 1 spot in GameTrailers' "Top 100 Video Game Trailers of All Time",
                for submerging the viewer into the BioShock universe and its enduring impact. In August 2012, IGN gave
                it the top spot on their list of the Top 25 Modern PC Games, a ranking of the best PC games released
                since 2006. In November 2012, Time named it one of the 100 greatest video games of all time. In July
                2015, the game placed 9th on USgamer's The 15 Best Games Since 2000 list.</p>

        <div class="sale me-4 ms-4">
            <h2>Sale</h2>
            <p class="text card">The Xbox 360 version was the third best-selling game of August 2007, with 490,900 copies. The Wall Street
                Journal reported that shares in Take-Two Interactive "soared nearly 20%" in the week following
                overwhelmingly favorable early reviews of the game. Take-Two Interactive announced that by June 5, 2008,
                over 2.2 million copies of BioShock had been shipped. In a June 10, 2008 interview, Roy Taylor, Nvidia's
                VP of Content Business Development, stated that the PC version has sold over one million copies.
                According to Take-Two Interactive's chairman Strauss Zelnick, the game had sold around 3 million copies
                by June 2009. By March 2010, BioShock has sold 4 million copies.</p>

        <div class="sequels me-4 ms-4">

            <h2>Sequels</h2>
            <p class="text card" >Main articles: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BioShock_2">BioShock 2</a>  and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BioShock_Infinite">BioShock Infinite</a> </p>
            <p class="text card">In response to the game's high sales and critical acclaim, Take-Two Interactive chairman Strauss Zelnick
                revealed in a post-earnings report call that the company now considered the game part of a franchise. He
                also speculated that any follow-ups would mimic the release cadence of Grand Theft Auto, with a new
                release
                expected every two years. 2K's president Christoph Hartmann stated that BioShock could have five
                sequels, comparing the franchise to the Star Wars movies.</p>

            <p class="text card">BioShock 2 was announced in 2008, with its development led by 2K Marin. Levine stated that Irrational
                (then
                2K
                Boston) was not involved in the game's sequel because they wanted to "swing for the fences" and try to
                come
                up
                with something "very, very different", which was later revealed as BioShock Infinite. BioShock 3 was
                also
                announced, with its release assumed to likely coincide with the BioShock film. BioShock 2 takes place
                about
                ten years following the events of the first game. The player assumes the role of Subject Delta, a
                precursor
                of
                the Big Daddies who must search the fallen city of Rapture for his former Little Sister, Eleanor.
                BioShock 2
                was
                released for Windows PC, Mac, Xbox 360, and the PlayStation 3 worldwide on February 9, 2010.</p>
