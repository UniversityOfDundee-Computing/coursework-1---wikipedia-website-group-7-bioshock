                <h2>Critical response</h2>
                <p>BioShock has received "universal acclaim", according to review aggregator Metacritic, with the game
                    receiving an average review score of 96/100 for Xbox 360 and Microsoft Windows, and 94/100 for
                    PlayStation 3. As of October 2020, it is one of the highest-rated games on Metacritic, tied with
                    several other games for the fourth-highest aggregate score. Mainstream press reviews have praised
                    the immersive qualities of the game and its political dimension. The Boston Globe described it as "a
                    beautiful, brutal, and disquieting computer game ... one of the best in years", and compared the
                    game to Whittaker Chambers' 1957 riposte to Atlas Shrugged, "Big Sister Is Watching You". Wired also
                    mentioned the Ayn Rand connection (a partial anagram of Andrew Ryan) in a report on the game which
                    featured a brief interview with Levine. The Chicago Sun-Times review said "I never once thought
                    anyone would be able to create an engaging and entertaining video game around the fiction and
                    philosophy of Ayn Rand, but that is essentially what 2K Games has done ... the rare, mature video
                    game that succeeds in making you think while you play".</p>
                <p>The Los Angeles Times review concluded, "Sure, it's fun to play, looks spectacular and is easy to
                    control. But it also does something no other game has done to date: It really makes you feel." The
                    New York Times reviewer described it as: "intelligent, gorgeous, occasionally frightening" and
                    added, "Anchored by its provocative, morality-based story line, sumptuous art direction and superb
                    voice acting, BioShock can also hold its head high among the best games ever made."</p>
                <p>GameSpy praised BioShock's "inescapable atmosphere", and Official Xbox Magazine lauded its
                    "inconceivably great plot" and "stunning soundtrack and audio effects." The gameplay and combat
                    system have been praised for being smooth and open-ended, and elements of the graphics, such as the
                    water, were commended for their quality. It has been noted that the combination of the game's
                    elements "straddles so many entertainment art forms so expertly that it's the best demonstration yet
                    how flexible this medium can be. It's no longer just another shooter wrapped up in a pretty game
                    engine, but a story that exists and unfolds inside the most convincing and elaborate and artistic
                    game world ever conceived."</p>
                <p>Reviewers did highlight a few negative issues in BioShock, however. The recovery system involving
                    "Vita-Chambers", which revive a defeated player at half-health, but do not alter the enemies'
                    health, makes it possible to wear down enemies through sheer perseverance, and was criticized as one
                    of the most significant flaws in the gameplay. IGN noted that both the controls and graphics of the
                    Xbox 360 version are inferior to those of the PC version, in that switching between weapons or
                    plasmids is easier using the PC's mouse than the 360's radial menu, as well as the graphics being
                    slightly better with higher resolutions. The game has been touted as a hybrid first-person shooter,
                    but two reviewers found advances from comparable games lacking, both in the protagonist and in the
                    challenges he faces. Some reviewers also found the combat behavior of the splicers lacking in
                    diversity (and their A.I. behavior not very well done), and the moral choice too much "black and
                    white" to be interesting. Some reviewers and essayists such as Jonathan Blow also claimed that the
                    "moral choice" the game offered to the player (saving or harvesting the little sisters) was flawed
                    because, to them, it had no real impact on the game, which ultimately lead them to think that the
                    sisters were just mechanics of no real importance. Daniel Friedman for Polygon concurred with Blow,
                    noting that the player only loses 10% of the possible ADAM rewards for saving the Little Sisters
                    rather than killing them, and felt that this would have been better instituted as part of the game
                    difficulty mechanic. Former LucasArts developer Clint Hocking wrote a noted essay that claimed that
                    BioShock exhibited "ludonarrative dissonance" between its story and mechanics, as while he saw the
                    story as advocating selflessness in helping others, its gameplay encourages what he views as
                    selfishness by preying on Little Sisters.</p>

        Sequels
        Main articles: BioShock 2 and BioShock Infinite
        In response to the game's high sales and critical acclaim, Take-Two Interactive chairman Strauss Zelnick
        revealed in a post-earnings report call that the company now considered the game part of a franchise. He
        also speculated that any follow-ups would mimic the release cadence of Grand Theft Auto, with a new release
        expected every two years. 2K's president Christoph Hartmann stated that BioShock could have five
        sequels, comparing the franchise to the Star Wars movies.

        BioShock 2 was announced in 2008, with its development led by 2K Marin. Levine stated that Irrational (then 2K
        Boston) was not involved in the game's sequel because they wanted to "swing for the fences" and try to come up
        with something "very, very different", which was later revealed as BioShock Infinite. BioShock 3 was also
        announced, with its release assumed to likely coincide with the BioShock film. BioShock 2 takes place about
        ten years following the events of the first game. The player assumes the role of Subject Delta, a precursor of
        the Big Daddies who must search the fallen city of Rapture for his former Little Sister, Eleanor. BioShock 2 was
        released for Windows PC, Mac, Xbox 360, and the PlayStation 3 worldwide on February 9, 2010.

        While BioShock Infinite, developed by Irrational Games and released in 2013, shares the name and many similar
        gameplay concepts with BioShock, the title is not a sequel or prequel of the original story, but instead takes
        place aboard the collapsing air-city of Columbia in the year 1912. It follows former Pinkerton agent Booker
        DeWitt as he is he attempts to rescue a young woman, Elizabeth, from the angelic tower in which her father has
        imprisoned her. Infinite involves the possibilities of multiple universes. In one scene, the game take
        place at the lighthouse and bathysphere terminus of Rapture as part of this exploration. However, no direct
        canonical connection is given in the main game. The episodic expansion, Burial at Sea, takes place in
        Rapture in 1959, before the war between Atlas and Ryan, while continuing the story of Booker and Elizabeth. This
        content links the two stories while providing expansion on the causes and behind-the-scenes events alluded to by
        the in-game background from BioShock.

        After completing BioShock Infinite and its expansion, Levine announced that he was restructuring Irrational
        Games to focus on smaller, narrative-driven titles. 2K Games continues to hold on to the BioShock intellectual
        property and plans to continue to develop games in this series, considering the framework set by Levine and his
        team as a "rich creative canvas" for more stories.

        Limited edition
        Following the creation of a fan petition for a special edition, Take-Two Interactive stated that they would
        publish a special edition of BioShock only if the petition received 5,000 signatures;[182] this number of
        signatures was reached after just five hours. Subsequently, a poll was posted on the 2K Games operated Cult
        of Rapture community website in which visitors could vote on what features they would most like to see in a
        special edition; the company stated that developers would take this poll into serious consideration. To
        determine what artwork would be used for the Limited Edition cover, 2K Games ran a contest, with the winning
        entry provided by Crystal Clear Art's owner and graphic designer Adam Meyer.

        On April 23, 2007, the Cult of Rapture website confirmed that the Limited Collector's Edition would include a
        6-inch (150 mm) Big Daddy figurine (many of which were damaged due to a dropped shipping container; a
        replacement initiative is in place), a "Making Of" DVD, and a soundtrack CD. Before the special edition was
        released, the proposed soundtrack CD was replaced with The Rapture EP.

        Remastered edition
        Main article: BioShock: The Collection
        BioShock was remastered to support 1080p and higher framerates as part of the 2016 BioShock: The Collection
        release for Windows, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One systems. The remastering was performed by Blind Squirrel Games
        and published by 2K Games. A standalone version of BioShock Remastered was released for macOS by Feral
        Interactive on August 22, 2017.The standalone version of the remastered version of BioShock along with The
        Collection were released on May 29, 2020 on the Nintendo Switch.

        Printed media
        BioShock: Breaking the Mold, a book containing artwork from the game, was released by 2K Games on August 13,
        2007. It is available in both low and high resolution, in PDF format from 2K Games' official website.
        Until October 1, 2007, 2K Games was sending a printed version of the book to the owners of the collector's
        edition whose Big Daddy figurines had been broken, as compensation for the time it took to replace them. On
        October 31, 2008, the winners of "Breaking the Mold: Developers Edition Artbook Cover Contest" were announced on
        cultofrapture.com.

        A prequel novel, titled BioShock: Rapture written by John Shirley, was published July 19, 2011. The prequel book
        details the construction of Rapture and the events leading to its demise. The book follows multiple BioShock
        characters.

        Canceled Universal film adaptation
        Industry rumors after the game's release suggested a film adaptation of the game would be made, utilizing
        similar green screen filming techniques as in the movie 300 to recreate the environments of Rapture.On May
        9, 2008, Take-Two Interactive announced a deal with Universal Studios to produce a BioShock movie, to be
        directed by Gore Verbinski and written by John Logan. The film was expected to be released in 2010, but was
        put on hold due to budget concerns.On August 24, 2009, it was revealed that Verbinski had dropped out of
        the project due to the studio's decision to film overseas to keep the budget under control. Verbinski reportedly
        feels this would have hindered his work on Rango. Then Juan Carlos Fresnadillo was in talks to direct with
        Verbinski as producer.

        In January 2010 the project was in the pre-production stage, with director Juan Carlos Fresnadillo and Braden
        Lynch, a voice artist from BioShock 2 both working on the film. By July, the film was facing budget issues,
        but producer Gore Verbinski said they were working it out. He also said the film would be a hard R. Ken
        Levine, during an interview on August 30, 2010, said: "I will say that it is still an active thing and it's
        something we are actively talking about and actively working on." Verbinski later cited that by trying to
        maintain the "R" rating, they were unable to find any studios that would back the effort, putting the film's
        future in jeopardy.

        Levine confirmed in March 2013 that the film had been officially canceled. Levine stated that after Warner's
        Watchmen film in 2009 did not do as well as the studio expected, they had concerns with the $200 million budget
        that Verbinski had for the BioShock film. They asked him to consider doing the film on a smaller $80 million
        budget, but Verbinski did not want to accept this. In February 2017, Verbinski said that his crew was about
        eight weeks from starting filming,with plans for many elaborate sets given that the setting of Rapture
        could not be something easily shot on existing locations, requiring the $200 million budget. Verbinski was
        anticipating on releasing the film with an R-rating when Universal approached him about changing the film's
        direction. Universal requested that he tone down the film and aim instead for a PG-13 movie, which would be able
        to draw more audiences to the film and recoup the larger budget he asked for. Verbinski insisted on keeping the
        R-rating and refused the smaller budget Universal offered to make the R-rated version. Universal felt that that
        expensive a film with the limited R-rating would be too much of a risk, and pulled him from the film.
        Universal then subsequently brought in a new director to work with the smaller budget, but Levine and 2K Games
        did not feel that the new director was a good fit with the material. Universal then let Levine decide to end the
        project, which he did, believing that the film would not work with the current set of compromises they would
        have had to make.

        In January 2014, artwork from the canceled film surfaced online, showing what an adaptation could have looked
        like. Verbinski said that there is "all kinds of crazy stuff" from the pre-production stage that still
        exists, such as screen tests for characters.[204] He noted in the 2017 Reddit piece that with the success of the
        2016 film Deadpool, he believes that there is now justification for his vision of the BioShock film.

        Netflix film adaptation
        In February 2022, Netflix announced it would be adapting the BioShock franchise into a film with Vertigo
        Entertainment and 2K, a subsidiary of Take-Two Interactive Software, Inc producing. Francis Lawrence was
        slated to direct with Michael Green to write, as of August 2022.
